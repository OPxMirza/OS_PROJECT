# 🖥️ Operating System Simulation Project

This project is a simplified Operating System (OS) simulation created for academic purposes.  
It demonstrates key OS concepts such as **Process Management, Memory Management, Scheduling Algorithms, Process Control Block (PCB)**, and an interactive **GUI-based Control Panel**.

## 🚀 Features

### **1. Control Panel (GUI)**
A user-friendly GUI that simulates core operating system functionalities:
- Process Management
- Memory Management
- Scheduling Algorithms
- PCB Viewer
- System Status Display

---

## 📌 Phase 1 — Control Panel & PCB (30 Points)

### **✔ Task 1.1 (15 Points)**
- Assign a name to your operating system  
- Build a complete **Control Panel GUI** with buttons for:
  - Process Management  
  - Memory Management  
  - CPU Scheduling  
  - System Tools  

### **✔ Process Control Block (PCB)**
Displays:
- Process ID  
- Arrival Time  
- Burst Time  
- Remaining Time  
- Priority  
- State (Ready/Running/Waiting/Terminated)

---

## ⚙️ Scheduling Algorithms Implemented

### **✓ FCFS (First Come First Serve)**  
Non-preemptive

### **✓ SJF (Shortest Job First)**  
- Non-preemptive  
- Preemptive (SRTF)

### **✓ Priority Scheduling**  
- Preemptive  
- Non-preemptive

### **✓ Round Robin**  
- With time quantum input

Each algorithm shows:
- Gantt Chart  
- Waiting Time  
- Turnaround Time  
- Response Time  
- Average WT/TAT

## 🧠 Memory Management
- Simulation of memory blocks  
- Allocation & Deallocation  
- Visualization of free/used memory  
- Uses First-Fit / Best-Fit / Worst-Fit (if applicable)
